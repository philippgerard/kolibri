## Requirements

* PHP 5.4+
* the Phalcon extension
* Composer
* sqlite3 support or some RDBMS (MySQL, PgSQL, Oracle, ...)
* 1 minute of free time

## Installation

1. SSH into your server
2. Use `git clone https://github.com/philippgerard/kolibri.git` to clone the repository to a desitination of your choice
3. If you intend to use Sqlite: set `chmod -r 777` to the `data` folder.
4. Rename `application/config/config.php.dist` to `application/config/config.php` and provide the required database information.
5. Use `sql/[your RDBMS].sql` to set up the base table structure.
6. Point your webserver to the `public` directory and make sure the rewrite-definition inside the `.htaccess` is used. Also make sure that only the `public` directory is world-accessible.
7. Run `composer.phar install` in the main directory of Kolibri to download the required third-party-libraries to the vendor directory. If you plan to develop Kolibri, you might want to download the dev libraries as well, use `composer.phar update` to do so.
8. Enjoy!
